# Lang Map

### Lang Map is an interactive tool that visualises where different languages are spoken around the world.

- The tool allows you to select a range of different languages, and have the countries that speak those languages highlighted on a map in different colours.
- It's been created using Typescript, Angular, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## FAQ:
### Why did you create this tool?

I've always been interested in languages, and how different languages have spread to different parts of the world. I wanted to create a way to see this information and interact with it.

### Why isn't a certain country or territory highlighted when selecting a specific language?

The data for the place isn't available from the API I'm using,
or wasn't on the list of places that speak the language I used.
Generally, I've only included countries where the language is an official language. 

### Why isn't a certain language available?

There are thousands of languages spoken around the world, so I've decided to only add a select few.
In the future, I may decide to add other languages.
